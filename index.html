        <h2>Studies</h2>
        <p>Currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. My studies include courses in:</p> <br>
        <h3>Year 1</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Analogue Electronics</li>
            <li>Digital Electronics</li>
            <li>Embedded Software in Context </li>
            <li>Electrical Principles and Machines</li>
            <li>Engineering Mathematics</li>
            <li>Electronic and Robot Design and Build</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The module I enjoyed most this year was Digital Electronics although the theory required patience to understand. On the other hand, this year I struggled with Embedded Software in Context since I am fairly new to programming.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Year 2</h3>
        <ul></ul>
            <li>Power Electronics and Generation</li>
            <li>Communication Systems</li>
            <li>Engineering Mathematics and Statistics</li>
            <li>Real Time Systems Project</li>
            <li>Control Engineering</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The module I enjoyed most this year was Power Electronics and Generation because of the delivery by the lecturer as well as the structure of the module. On the other hand, this year I struggled with Real Time Systems Project as it was both an individual and group work module based around programming which is not my strongest suit.</p>
